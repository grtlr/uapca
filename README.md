You can find a preprint of our paper at [arXiv:1905.01127](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01127) or on my [personal website](https://www.jgoertler.com).
We also extracted means and covariances from the [*student grade* dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grtlr/uapca/master/data/student_grades.json).

## Development

The dependencies can be install using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
```

Builds can be prepared using:

```bash
yarn run build
yarn run dev # watches for changes
```

Run tests:

```bash
yarn run test
```
    
To perform linter checks you there is:

```bash
yarn run lint
yarn run lint-fix # tries to fix some of the warnings
```
